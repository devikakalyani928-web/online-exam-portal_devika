ONLINE EXAM PORTAL

1.PROJECT OVERVIEW 

Project Title:Online Exam Portal
Tech Stack:MERN(MongoDB,Express,React,Node.js)

2.PROBLEM STATEMENT

Traditional examination systems are time-consuming and inefficient, as they involve manual question paper preparation, answer evaluation, and result processing. These methods often lead to human errors, delays in result declaration, and excessive use of paper. Conducting exams manually also makes it difficult to prevent malpractice and retakes. There is no instant evaluation system, and maintaining exam records becomes complex and insecure. Hence, there is a need for an automated online examination system that allows administrators to create tests easily, enables users to take exams securely, automatically evaluates answers, calculates scores instantly, and restricts multiple attempts, ensuring accuracy, transparency, and efficiency in the examination process.

3.Proposed System

The proposed system is a web-based Online Exam Portal designed to automate the examination process. In this system, the administrator has full control over creating, managing, and scheduling online tests by adding multiple-choice questions with four options. Users can securely log in and take the exam within the given rules. The system automatically evaluates the submitted answers and calculates the final score instantly. To ensure fairness and prevent misuse, the system restricts users from attempting the same exam more than once. All exam data, including questions, user details, and results, are stored securely in a database. This system reduces manual work, saves time, improves accuracy, and ensures a transparent examination process.

Features of the Proposed System


a. Online Test Management
The administrator can create, edit, and manage online examinations by adding multiple-choice questions with four options. Tests can be activated or deactivated as required.
b. Secure User Authentication
Users must register and log in using valid credentials before attending the examination. This ensures secure access and prevents unauthorized usage.
c. Automated Evaluation and Result Calculation
The system automatically evaluates the answers submitted by the user and calculates the total score instantly, eliminating manual correction and human errors.
d. Retake Prevention Mechanism
The system restricts users from attempting the same exam more than once, ensuring fairness and preventing misuse of the examination process.
e. Real-Time Result Display
After submission of the exam, users can immediately view their results, including total marks and correct answers.
f. Data Storage and Management
All exam details, user information, and results are securely stored in the database for future reference and reporting.
g. User-Friendly Interface
The system provides a simple and easy-to-use interface that allows users and administrators to navigate the portal without technical difficulty.
